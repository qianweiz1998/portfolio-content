                Here are the selected work from 2016 to 2022. I have an architecture design back ground. And I like painting and sketching in my free time.

                    The design aims to create a toy library adjacent to the old library where kids and young people can borrow toys and have fun.  
                    The library is a colorful space with different small boxes of play and exhibition space inserted within a large volume.

                    The brief of this project is mainly about designing a sport club on the hills by Dongqian Lake, which is at the south part of China. 
                    The idea of playing sport in an area with such beautiful scenery and major elevation difference made rock climbing a perfect choice. 
                    The main concept of my project is to offer people a “watch tower” by siting most of the space for support services on top of the main climbing area, 
                    a 50m wall linking the climbing tracks of different height and difficulty.

                    The project in a contemporary museum locating at a historical part of Montreal, the old port. It is a renovation project focusing on 
                    the preservation and alternation of three of the oldest building heritage in Montreal. I used the concept of tubes, a linear space with 
                    two open ends as the composition of the new parts of the project.

                    The site locates at the turning point of Sichuan North Road, a main road of the city. Besides, at a crowded part of Shanghai with a park, 
                    a stadium and residential zones adjacent to it, the site determines that the urban complex aims mostly toward people arriving on foot. 
                    So the concept of my design is to attract those people passing by with carefully placed public space and passage ways that forms an oblique 
                    angle with the original road system of the city.

                    This is a project designed for students of our own college, the College of Architecture and Urban Planning. It locates on the university campus, 
                    right in front of the north gate. The main function is for the students, teacher or even visitor to watch, discuss and comment on the studio work 
                    of students. My main goal of this project is to create a public space where everyone passing through can feel welcomed and attracted by the 
                    exhibitions of students’ design.

                    Compete with 56 groups from 14 universities. Constructed a 1:1 scale temporary resting booth with pp sheets. Developed repetitive structural unit. 
                    Collaborated with teammates to build up main half dome structure.

                My works: The Library of Toys, Edge of the Cliff, The Tubes, Extending the Street Corners, and Transitional Space are some of my most profound architectural design projects.
