                The design aims to create a toy library adjacent to the old library where kids and young people can borrow toys and have fun. 
                The main reason why we need a toy library is that Ann Arbor is a city with a great population of young people and students. 
                Besides, the sharing of toys has great benefits in terms of sustainability, lowering family budget, and encouraging communication between kids.  
                The library is a colorful space with different small boxes of play and exhibition space inserted within a large volume. 
                And kids can run around rooms of different hight and scale and enrich their imagination in this distinctive space of games and toys.
